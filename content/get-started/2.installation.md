## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites

Make sure to have the following installed in your OS:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com) </br>
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) </br>
- [Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) </br>

## üöÄ Quick start

If you do not consider yourself a developer who is working, contributing or tweaking
your own instance of the platform, the fastest way to access the platform would be to simply
navigate to the latest instance available at [applications.linkedpipes.com](https://applications.linkedpipes.com).

If you do, the consequite sections will guide you through all possible installation scenarious.

### Running locally

The most basic and simply option to start the platform locally is to run these commands:

```bash
$ curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/linkedpipes/applications/master/lpa-cli.sh -o lpa-cli.sh && ./lpa-cli.sh --production-no-cloning
```

After starting all containers, simply navigate to [localhost:9001](http://localhost:9001) in your preferred browser.

Please note, this doesn't require cloning the project's repository.
However, make sure to have latest versions of **docker** and **docker-compose** available on your system.

### Cloning the repository

If you want to have access to more advanced **docker-compose** startup configurations, make sure to clone the repository project first.

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/linkedpipes/applications
$ cd ./applications
```

Once you navigate into the root folder of cloned repository, refer to the **lpa-cli.sh** commands description to get access to all possible
**docker-compose** configurations to start the platform locally:

```bash
usage: ./lpa-cli.sh [-dc]|[--detailed-command]
-d   | --development                  Start non persistent development setup (assumes repository is already cloned)
-dp  | --development-persistent       Start non persistend development setup (assumes repository is already cloned)
-p   | --production                   Start persistend production setup (assumes repository is already cloned)
-pnc | --production-no-cloning        Start persistend production setup [NO CLONING REQUIRED ;-)]
-cs  | --clean-storage                Remove 'appdata' and 'data' folders with database data and etc
-sc  | --stop-compose                 Setup whatever configuration setup is currently running
-h   | --help                         Print help documentation
```

You can also investigate the commands inside the **lpa-cli.sh** script for more details. The script itself is essentially a very simple wrapper around various
**docker-compose** related commands.

#### Default ports

Regardless of whether you cloned repository or used the **no-cloning** option, once you have started the instance of the platform in
**docker-compose**, individual components will be accessible on the following ports by default:

‚Ä¢ **Frontend** of LPA at localhost:9001 <br />
‚Ä¢ **Backend** of LPA at localhost:9005 <br />
‚Ä¢ **Discovery** at localhost:9000 <br />
‚Ä¢ **ETL** at localhost:8080 <br />
‚Ä¢ **Virtuoso** at localhost:8890
